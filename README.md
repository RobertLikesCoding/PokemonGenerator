# What is this?

This is a simple program that creates a random Pokemon name, showing it's element and hit points (hp).

## Why did you make this?

This is a project from my Codecademy Web Developer Course. I was supposed to create a random message where 3 parts of that message were supposed to be random.

## What's happening in the code?

I created 2 arrays. One is containing 23 names the other one contains 11 elements. For both of these I created a function that picks a name/element using the `Math.random` method. The hp are being generated the same way. To add some diversity I added an if statement. Whenever the picked name has less then 5 letters, "mon" will be added to the end of the name.
Using string concatenation the code will then output a new Pokemon.
